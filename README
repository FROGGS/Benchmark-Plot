Simple Perl 6 script for turning a benchmark output run into SVG graphs.

To use:

    perl6 bin/graph-bench.pl [result-file]
    
result-file is a comma-separated file where each line has a Rakudo version,
a benchmark filename, and an average time.  (Extra values are ignored.)

    latest-rakudo, trans-sprintf.pl, 5.1236996
    rakudo-star-2010.07, iteration.p6, 1.709158
    rakudo-star-2010.07, trans-sprintf.pl, 3.1849216
    rakudo-star-2010.08, iteration.p6, 1.498886
    
small-results.txt is a sample results file included with this repository.

Rakudo versions are sorted by string name, except for latest-rakudo, which is
automagically the last one.  This will then result in SVG files for the graphs,
at the moment, one for each benchmark:

    iteration.p6.svg
    trans-sprintf.pl.svg
